The advantage of throwing exceptions is that the program is able to print/display a customized error message to the
users when their input is invalid. However, the program will stop running if the error is thrown.
On the other hand, advantage static factory of is the program will not really throw out any error and force the application
to stop running. This is because it will just set the object to null value if the user entered an invalid input.
