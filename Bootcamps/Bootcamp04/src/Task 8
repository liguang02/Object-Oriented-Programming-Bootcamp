Use a for loop to iterate through the edu.monash.fit2099.vehicles.Vehicle list in CarAuction class and for every car
we iterate through the bid list which contains the client object, thus we can use the
description() implemented in client class to print the client details.

It is necessary to start the iteration at edu.monash.fit2099.vehicles.Vehicle arraylist as it contains all the bids which
contains the client object.

To solve the duplication problem, I would do a if check statement to see if the clientname
has already been shown before in previous iteration by comparing it with a temporary arraylist
that stores all the clientnames that it printed.

I would implement the this list all edu.monash.fit2099.clients.Client method in CarAuction class as this is where
the user input all the data and it has access to car, bid and client class.

pseudocode:
for i < car_array.size(), i++:
    for j < bid_array.size(), j++:
        if clientName not in clientName_lst:
            client.description();
            clientName_lst.add(clientName);
