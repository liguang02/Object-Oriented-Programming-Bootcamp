Advantage of using numeric data type for the clientID is that it can be used in implementations that involves calculations.
For example, we can increment the clientid by one to look up the next client.

Advantage of using string data type is that it can contain a relatively large number of clients as it has a base of 26 (typically
we would use the alphabets A-Z in the clientid) with the numeric only having a base of 10.
